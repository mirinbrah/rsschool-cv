  <h1>My CV for Rs-School</h1>
  <h2>You can contact me through [my Github page](https://github.com/mirinbrah)</h2>
  	<p>I am 29 years old and I am looking for a new area of employment. 
	I live in Perm city, Russia.
	Unfortunately, I have a gap of 8 years of unofficial low-class jobs.
	But I'm a cheerful and optimistic guy.
	I have no experience with code, but I am quick to learn.
	And I hope that I became professional in gamedev one day.
	</p>
	<p>I have never tried online courses before and this is my 1st one.
		I speak English at A2 level and and I have an incomplete higher education in the humanities specialty (history).
